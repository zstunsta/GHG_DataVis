To ensure that this code functions as intended:

- Download all files into the same directory folder.
- Comment out or change the function calls at the bottom of the script.  
    - If the script is ran "as is" it will create all of the plots in the Figures folder.
    - There are other functions in this script that are not currently being called.  See section 2. below
    
    
- This script has three sections. 
 1. Import and clean data
 2. Use descriptive statistics to explore the datasets and explore distribution and outliers.
 3. Plot charts and visualizations to help compare data and search for patterns.
