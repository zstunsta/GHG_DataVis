# Green House Gass & Rice Crop Production

To ensure that this code functions as intended:

- Download all files into the same directory folder.
- Comment out or change the function calls at the bottom of the script.  
    - If the script is ran "as is" it will create all of the plots in the Figures.zip folder.
    - There are other functions in this script that are not currently being called.  See section 2. below
    
    
- This script was written with three sections in mind. 
 1. Import and clean data
 2. Use descriptive statistics to explore the datasets and explore distribution and outliers.
 3. Plot charts and visualizations to help compare data and search for patterns.

- Future plans for this code are to create linear regression plots and to explore covariance between rice harvest estimates and Methane emisions.
